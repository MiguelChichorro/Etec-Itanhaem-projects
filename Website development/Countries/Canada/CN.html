					<p>Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.</p>
					<p>Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British Parliament.</p>
					<p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, who serves as head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.</p>
					<p>A highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.</p>

						<p><b>Toronto</b>, city, capital of the province of Ontario, southeastern Canada. It is the most populous city in Canada, a multicultural city, and the country’s financial and commercial centre. Its location on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, which forms part of the border between Canada and the United States, and its access to Atlantic shipping via the St. Lawrence Seaway and to major U.S. industrial centres via the Great Lakes have enabled Toronto to become an important international trading centre. Moreover, the city is positioned on the edge of some of the best farmland in Canada, with a climate favourable to growing a wide range of crops, thereby making Toronto a transportation, distribution, and manufacturing centre. Most importantly, its central location, along with a host of political policies favouring international trade, places this city with the greatest economic ties to, and influence from, the United States. Since the second half of the 20th century the city has grown phenomenally, from a rather sedate provincial town—“Toronto the Good”—to a lively, thriving, cosmopolitan metropolitan area. Area 244 square miles (632 square km); metro. area, 2,280 square miles (5,905 square km). Pop. (2011) 2,615,060; metro. area, 5,583,064; (2016) 2,731,571; metro. area, 5,928,040.</p>

The city of Montreal occupies about three-fourths of Montreal Island (Île de Montréal), the largest of the 234 islands of the Hochelaga Archipelago, one of three archipelagoes near the confluence of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers. Area 141 square miles (365 square km); metro. area, 1,644 square miles (4,259 square km). Pop. (2011) 1,649,519; metro. area, 3,934,078; (2016) 1,704,694; metro. area, 4,098,927.</p>

						<p><b>Ottawa</b>, city, capital of Canada, located in southeastern Ontario. In the eastern extreme of the province, Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River across from Gatineau, Quebec, at the confluence of the Ottawa (Outaouais), Gatineau, and Rideau rivers. The Ottawa River (some 790 miles [1,270 km] long), the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence River, was a key factor in the city’s settlement and development; its watershed, covering more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km), facilitated the transport of resources such as furs, timber, and minerals from the region. The river’s Chaudière Falls, just west of the Rideau Canal, while initially a navigational hazard for the fur trade and later for the transport of logging rafts, ultimately proved to be an asset in the production of hydroelectric power for the city and a boon to the growth of industry.</p>

It is situated on the western edge of the Great Plains, in the foothills of the spectacular Canadian Rockies (about 60 miles [100 km] to the west), and the surrounding valleys and uplands are a distinct change from the flat prairie landscapes typical of the region. A relatively young Canadian city, it is the administrative and financial headquarters of the country’s petroleum industry. Calgary also celebrates its history as a cattle-ranching capital, an image enhanced by the city’s hosting of the annual Calgary Stampede, a 10-day rodeo-centred event. In the early 21st century, Calgary was one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada. Area 319 square miles (825 square km); metro. area, 1,972 square miles (5,108 square km). Pop.

Transportation has been the cornerstone of the settlement and development of Edmonton. The North Saskatchewan River was a major conduit for the historic fur trade, which established trading posts near what is now Edmonton. The advent in the early 1900s of railways and later of roads, oil and gas pipelines, and an international airport transformed the city into a transportation centre known as the “Gateway to the North.” It is the service and supply centre for the oil industry as well as the petrochemical centre for western Canada.

One of the oldest cities in Canada—having celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008—Quebec city has a distinct old-world character and charm. It is the only remaining walled city in North America north of Mexico and was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985. Among its other distinguishing characteristics are its narrow cobblestone streets, stone buildings, fortifications, and rich French Canadian culture grounded in the French language. The city’s splendid views of the surrounding landscape and unique character were noted as early as 1842 during a visit by Charles Dickens, who called Quebec the “Gibraltar of North Amerca.” In addition to being a major tourist destination, Quebec is an administrative centre and a port city for transatlantic trade. Its location at the confluence of the St. Lawrence and Saint-Charles rivers, about 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Montreal, provided a number of strategic military advantages: because of the narrowing of the St. Lawrence River, Quebec was the farthest upstream oceangoing vessels could navigate, and the city’s fortifications on a high ridge had a commanding view of the river.

						<p><b>Saskatoon</b>, city, south-central Saskatchewan, Canada, on the South Saskatchewan River. It was founded in 1883 as the proposed capital of a temperance colony, and its name was derived from Mis-sask-quah-toomina, a Cree word for a local edible red berry. Following the arrival of the railroad from Regina (161 miles [259 km] southeast) in 1890 and its amalgamation with two adjoining settlements (1906), Saskatoon experienced rapid growth. As Saskatchewan’s most populous metropolitan area, Saskatoon is a distribution and service centre for an important wheat-, oats-, barley-, rye-, flaxseed-, and canola-growing region. Mining is also a vital part of Saskatoon’s economy, and the area is among the world’s leading producers of uranium and potash. Natural gas and oil extraction and refining have also grown in importance in Saskatchewan and Saskatoon. Other significant industries include food and dairy processing, printing, and the manufacture of wood products, chemicals, clothing, machinery, computer and electronic products, metal, and fabricated metal products. Local industry also benefits from the numerous research facilities located in Saskatoon, including Canadian Light Source, Inc., which carries out synchrotron research.

Serving as a British garrison town during the mid-19th century, London developed into an important transportation and industrial centre as a result of its interlake location. Today it is the hub of extensive rail and highway networks radiating into the surrounding agricultural region, which produces fruit, vegetables, grain, and dairy products. London’s industries include the manufacture of food products, brass and steel products, diesel locomotives, textiles, electrical appliances, and clothing.

					<h1 style="text-align: center;">Canadian cultural values and beliefs</h1>
					<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Transparentcanadacultureicon.png" alt="Canada leaf">
					<p>Canadians are known to be some of the most polite, tactful, and peace-loving human beings on the planet. In fact, a stereotypical Canadian is depicted as one who apologizes despite not being at fault. To a certain extent, this is true. The society greatly values tolerance, humility as well as non-violence.</p>
					<p>To be sure, Canadians have individual traits and quirks. However, the following are 10 more cultural norms generally observed in Canadian society. These are what they value highly and underlie many of their behaviours. Having an idea of these will help you have a deeper understanding of Canadians and guide you in your own cultural immersion.</p>
					<div class="Egalitarianism">
						<h2>1.Egalitarianism</h2>
						<p>In an egalitarian society, people are deemed equal. This is why the hierarchy is not very evident. Everyone is deserving of equal rights and opportunities in this society regardless of gender, age, race or beliefs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Informality">
						<h2>2.Informality</h2>
						<p>Most Canadians are casual in dress and language. You will notice that there are no strict dress codes in the workplace (unless you work in a bank or law office). Clothes are informal to casual. Generally, everyone is on a first-name basis. Even seniors (or superiors) are addressed by their first names. However, when meeting a person for the first time, it would be safe to address them by Mr./Mrs./Ms. (or a professional title like Dr.) and their last name. More often than not, they will tell you that you may address them by their first name especially when you become more familiar with one another.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Order_and_space">
						<h2>3.Order and space</h2>
						<p>Canadians value order and preserving their personal space. They also value personal privacy. It will be wise to keep away from discussions of salary, family life, weight, religion and other personal topics. It is also understood that a person has rights over his/her own property, so make sure to ask permission before using anything that is not yours. Disruptive behavior, such as cutting in line, speaking out of turn, shouting, talking loudly are definitely frowned upon. Decorum is part of keeping order and respecting other people’s space.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Individualistic_yet_community-oriented">
						<h2>4.Individualistic yet community-oriented</h2>
						<p>Canadians are highly aware of their responsibility to the community. Despite being individualistic in terms of personal values (such as guarding personal space), contributing to the betterment of the community is a priority. Canadians get involved by volunteering, donating, and by generally maintaining pride and affinity for their community.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Punctuality">
						<h2>5.Punctuality</h2>
						<p>Being on time is highly valued in Canada. Punctuality is a sign of respect. Everyone is expected to arrive on time or at least 5-10 minutes earlier. Similarly, deadlines are taken seriously. It is equivalent to honoring your commitments. It is also an indication of your integrity.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Respect">
						<h2>6.Respect</h2>
						<p>This trait often manifests itself through politeness, punctuality, tolerance and social order. It is considered harassment to talk disparagingly about a person’s looks, beliefs, age, gender and status in life. Most of the time, communication is moderately indirect as an effort to be polite and diplomatic. However, Canadians may openly disagree, but tactfully. Do take note that verbal communication is also pragmatic especially in the workplace. You are expected to be clear and direct, not to “beat around the bush” and speak up for yourself.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Multiculturalism_and_diversity">
						<h2>7.Multiculturalism and diversity</h2>
						<p>Historically, Canada began developing into a strong nation by welcoming immigrants. Today, it continues to value the richness and diversity that various cultures contribute to society. In 1971, Canada became the first country in the world to adapt multiculturalism as an official policy. This affirmed people’s rights to maintain their unique cultural identity and promoted cross-cultural understanding and harmony.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Political_correctness">
						<h2>8.Political correctness</h2>
						<p>Political correctness is refraining from saying or doing things that exclude, insult or marginalize groups of people. And because Canada is diverse and multicultural, knowing how to be politically correct is essential in order to live harmoniously with everyone.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Regionalism">
						<h2>9.Regionalism</h2>
						<p>Most Canadians are said to have an affinity to their province or region, sometimes more than their country. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “regional identities were formed after Europeans settled across the continent among distinct First Nations tribes. Today, regionalism is expressed in various provincial identities, in our economy, and in the daily textures of life in different parts of the land.” These may be generalizations but it is said that the Atlantic provinces (the Maritimes and Newfoundland and Labrador) are somewhat reserved and old-fashioned; Ontario is business-like and conservative; people in Western Canada (Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan) are seen as open and friendly; British Columbia is unconventional and progressive; Quebec is distinct and autonomous; and the North (Yukon, the Northern Territories and Nunavut) has a strong pioneering spirit.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Love_for_the_environment">
						<h2>10.Love for the environment</h2>
						<p>Canadians bear a strong pride in their rich and bountiful resources and have deep-seated respect for the environment. You will see this in how they appreciate nature and revel in camping. They also maintain their parks and open spaces, and adopt and follow environment-friendly policies.</p>
